    Etsy is a place I've heard good things about from friends and family. It seems like a very solid and reliable place to purchase clothes, furniture, electronics, and accessories, but since I have never purchased anything through the site, it would be a bit difficult for me to criticize or evaluate the website's business and communication integrity. That being said, I can provide my humble opinion of the site's design and interface decisions knowing that those remarks are a bit more justified.
    
    The site kind of reminds me of Pinterest the way it's laid out (images unevenly placed vertically and horizontally throughout), but this site actually allows you the ability to purchase items instead of pinning them to an imaginary board. The way that they give you a chance to look at items based more off of pictures is exciting as a customer. If I was headed to the website for something specific, I would be able to see if the site carries it very easily, but I also wouldn't have any objections to browsing for things to buy if I headed to the page aimlessly. In a world where Amazon and Ebay take up most of the online purchasing market, it's exciting to see websites like Etsy that are trying to change up the way we search for products. I mean Etsy's selection of items is nowhere near the amount of products Amazon covers, but it seems like Etsy is more about quality than about quantity. 
    
    Overall, I like the way the website looks, the layout, and the general theme of the site. I'm not a big fan of the logo on the upper left hand side of the page, though. It looks a little outdated to me for some reason. It could be the color that's throwing me off, but there;s something there that just seems kind of boring. The website seems easy to navigate and is generally pleasing to the eyes, so I don't have too much to complain about.
