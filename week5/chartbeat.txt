Chartbeat is an awesome looking website. The simple yet extremely complex things that are going on is mind-blowing. I was immediately impressed with the way that the site looked. I love the shapes that change as you scroll down the home page as well as the ridiculous amount of information they are able to give you pertaining to your website traffic. 

A lot of the information throughout this website kind of went right over my head, but they did a beautiful job of making me want to know. It's not that often that websites dealing with high intensity math equations also have well designed webpages, but these guys clearly know what they're doing when it comes to numbers, code, and design. 

I'm a big fan of the subtle blues and reds that they've used throughout the site. It's never over the top and it adds just enough flavor to keep it all from getting boring. My only criticism about the site (which isn't really about the site) is that the subject matter is pretty intense. I understand that they're all about numbers from 'your website' but it's all a little intellectually overwhelming for me.
