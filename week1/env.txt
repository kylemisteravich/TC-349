      I’m fairly new when it comes to web design. I’ve taken a couple of introductory online classes here at MSU that mainly revolved around a Dreamweaver centered workflow. The instructor would show us how to do a couple of things every week through video tutorials and readings and we would have the remainder of the week to get these tasks done. Coming in with no knowledge of the software, code, techniques, or the processes that come along with web development, I just went by the recommendations of the instructor (which primarily revolved around using Dreamweaver).       Coming into TC 349 a little rusty on html and unsure of my development skills in general, I have again chosen to mimic the workflow of the instructor to both avoid confusion as well as get a feeling for how more experienced designers choose to work. It’s difficult for me to choose which pieces of software would work to my benefit when I’m just starting to understand how everything works.      That being said, I’m choosing to dedicate my time in this class to using Textmate, Google Chrome, the standard OS X Terminal application, and GitHub (of course). I was really confused during the first week of class trying to figure out how to get all the applications to sync together and how to get all of my work uploaded to Github through terminal commands, but I’ve got a decent grip on how things mingle with each other now and I plan on building upon the foundations of what I’ve learned so far.             -Kyle Misteravich
