<h3>Critique</h3>

    <p>Panic.com is a beautifully designed website. A simple user interface can go a long way in the cluttered information age that we currently live in. I can't even tell you how many times I've wandered onto a professionally done website where everything seemed to be cluttered. I was confused at what exactly the company was trying to accomplish with their product/site and when I finally wrapped my head around it all, I still had to make my way through a poorly designed layout to finish my goal.</p>
    
    <p>It might seem like a minute thing to be complaining about, but I really enjoy visiting websites where everything is laid out right in front of you, yet there are things you still want to know - forcing you to dig deeper into that space. Panic.com does a great job at this. You are welcomed to the site with the company logo, products that they've created, and the option to dig deeper into the small world that they have created. There is a sense of mystery and intrigue that draws you in while still being informative enough to keep you interested.</p>
    
    <p>Where this website could do better, as far as my two cents is concerned, is the opening page layout (and these are very small changes). The product icons seem a little bit too big for my taste. I really like the large icon size, but I think it would better suit the site to have all five icons laid out in a line next to each other and slightly minimized instead of have three on top and two on bottom. That way all products are immediately shown to the potential consumer and they know right away what they can purchase without having to scroll down the page. I do understand why they have the staggered icon approach though, seeing as the two icons at the bottom are for iOS devices and not for OS X. I just feel that laying everything out next to each other would suit the site better.</p>
