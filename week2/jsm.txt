      Upon first visiting Jason Santa Maria’s website (jasonsantamaria.com), I was impressed. The layout is fairly easy to understand, the colors are easy on the eyes, and everything is very legible. It doesn’t take too long to find what you are there for and it has a beautiful user interface. I’m a big fan of how the stories look upon the first click. They open up in a new page and give you all the information right there -avoiding all the clutter that sometimes comes with personal websites. It only took me a couple of minutes to explore through most of what the website had to offer, and I wouldn’t say that’s really a bad thing.       If I had to pick out things that I think could be done better, I would recommend that he change the way the first page looks. It’s not awful by any means, but it leaves something to be desired. It doesn’t grab my attention as much as it should and seems a bit too linear. I think he was right in a sense by trying to make the website seem logical and straight forward by organizing the first page similarly to a calendar, but judging by some of his other works, I think he could do it a bit better.  I think the site would look more appealing if he made the list a little more compact, pushed it to one of the sides - allowing for a little bit more breathing room as well as a space to put a couple of pictures or videos to draw the user in.             That being said, he has a great website under his belt – it just needs to have some tinkering done to it graphically to make it all come together a little smoother. Some of the layouts start to seem boring, but could be wonderfully engaging if a little more work was out into them. Honestly though, I’m impressed with the quality presented.
