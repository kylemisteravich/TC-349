    <h1>Foldable.me Card Sorting</h1>
    <p>In order to faithfully dissect the hierarchy and structural layout of <i>Foldable.me</i>, I had to spend some time looking through the entire website and explore every nook and cranny available. Although it seems like a simple website at first, it took me a good amount of time to figure out where everything leads. Many of the buttons and clickable links on the website are no-brainers and take you where you'd expected them to, but there are always those smaller print buttons at the bottom of the page or links within links many people might overlook.
    </p>
    <p>To start off, I jotted down every clickable button on one page of the website and tried to figure out if any of them could be grouped together. I then went to the next page and tried to do the same thing while still keeping the content from the previous page in mind. As I dug deeper into the content, things started to group together and I was able to throw away some of the cards for the sake of organization and simplicity. Some of the things I had written down like "green polo shirt" or "feedback submission button" started to seem unnecessary and I felt justified in deleting them from the list.
    </p>
    <p>After I had compiled a list full of the websites general content architecture  and button layout, I used the website <i>uxpunk.com/websort</i> to organize all of the data I had gathered into an intuitive card sorting interface in order to be sorted by myself and a couple of my friends. First, I had two of my friends look over the website for a couple of minutes and then told them to sort the information based on their experience. I quietly observed as they took a second to put things in the categories they saw appropriate and (surprisingly) a lot of their choices started to resemble mine. I didn't persuade them into any opf their choices and let them figure it out themselves. They did get a little confused by the "Footer" group I had made, but things worked out after a few seconds of explanation.
        </p>
        <p>The end result is what is on this page. I arranged the groups in a pyramid looking structure with the main navigation buttons on the top and everything else that spawns off of those concepts farther down the page. The arrows point to groups that are located inside of other groups to make everything as clear as possible.</p>
