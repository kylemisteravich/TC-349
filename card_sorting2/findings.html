    <h3>Personal Website Findings</h3>
    <p>
    So the layout for my personal site is noticeably smaller than the card layout for Foldable.me - which is no real surprise. If I was an up-and-coming small business, my website would need to be much more comprehensive, but I can only write so much about myself. I'm sure as time goes on, I may think of certain aspects of my personality that I have left out of my page and I'll be able to easily whip a new page, button, paragraph, or whatever it is in order to fill out my website a bit more, but what I have now is everything I can think of. I chose to display my findings through imagery again this time, but I didn't think that the arrows were necessary since this layout is much simpler. What I have come up with though, is a fairly extensive list of things I can display on my personal website/resume.

    <p>When testing this layout on a friend, the sorting cards on <i>websort.net</i> were much easier and quicker to understand than the cards for <i>foldable.me</i>. It was only a matter of minutes before he was able to put everything in it's respective place in the order that I imagined it should be. There are only a handful of subjects and ideas that I have to work with right now, so it's not a big surprise to me that this didn't take as long to sort out. I'm satisfied with where my layout is at, though, and I look forward to working on my site in the coming weeks.
