    <h3>Final Project Design</h3>
    <p>I will be doing a more in depth and complete personal website for my final project. I plan on starting from scratch, or making multiple additions to what I have already started over the past few weeks. I'm not the most interesting person ever, but I think I'll have enough content to fill out the website proportionally. Personally, when a website has too much content, it can actually get a little overwhelming - so it wouldn't be the end of the world if I can't think of 20+ pages of content to fill my site. My goal is to focus more on the design and interactivity of the website in order for possible future use as a portfolio piece. Either way, designing my webpage will give me a better understanding of what it takes to build a solid site.</p>
