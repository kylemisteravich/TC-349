I really like the way that United Pixel Workers is set up. It has very slick webpage layout that flows into each other sections of the website seamlessly. The navigation is effortless and the overall look and appeal of the website is something that I personal aspire to one day create. I'm a big fan of minimalism and stripping things down to their very core and getting rid of needless clutter - especially when it comes to web design. I can't tell you how many times I've visited a site that had multiple overly-saturated multi-colored buttons that were just too busy and distracting for me to even pay attention. It's always refreshing to see a company that thinks thoroughly about how they are going to simplify the process for all of their visitors. 

I'm not claiming to be a design aficionado or some kind of arty snob, because I understand how difficult it can be to make a good-looking website - but it's also very easy to leave unnecessary things out entirely. I think that's something a lot of designers should start thinking about if they haven't already - simplicity (but not so much that it becomes confusing). 

That being said, I do have a few minor complaints about the United Pixel Workers website. The colors seem a bit off. It might just be a personal taste complaint, but I'm not a big fan of putting a bright orange and a dark blue together (If you lighten them up, though, it's a different story entirely). They seem like too cold of a color combination - it makes me feel slightly uncomfortable for some reason and I'm not sure why. I do appreciate and commend their unique color choices though. A lot of websites are starting to share color palettes and it can get a bit redundant. Overall, a very very solid website though.
