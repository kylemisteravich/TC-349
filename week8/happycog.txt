These guys know what they're doing. Happy Cog looks and functions like very sophisticated modern website. The design, user interface, colors, navigation, and overall usability is remarkable. Happy Cog is probably my favorite (design-wise) of all the websites we've had to critique so far; with that one math and statistics website in a close second place. I mean if I was looking for a company to help design a website for my business or creative endeavors, I could only hope to snag Happy Cog to get the job done. I'll bet that it would be a pretty penny to actually get them to do the job based on all of the awards and big name websites that they've worked on. 

I really like how complex, yet simple their website is. There's nothing worse than a website whose obvious flashiness detracts from the overall feel of the website - using unnecessary transitions between pages, overzealous button gaudiness, and over saturated colors. Designers who want people to admire their technical abilities usually end up making crap websites in my experience. A good design and navigation system is way more important and can make or break a website almost all of the time.

It's been done a million times, but I like the way that Happy Cog puts most (if not all) of their information on one webpage allowing the user to scroll through everything. The buttons are beautiful as well. The way they slowly change from white to a salmon colored text is unique and adds depth to a section of the webpage that is often ignored stylistically. Overall, Happy Cog is brilliant. Well designed, sophisticated, modern, and easy.
