    <p>Here are a couple of things that I've worked on in the past for fun, classes, or just as resume builders. The top picture is something that I put together in Photoshop while experimenting with colors. I'm a big fan of juxtaposing black and white images with vivid colors. The picture on the bottom is a screen shot of a character I modeled while using Maya for a class this past fall... It's OK to laugh at this guy - I try not to take myself too seriously.</p>
