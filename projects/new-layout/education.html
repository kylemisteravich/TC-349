    <p>When you're from such a small town like Richmond, MI, you go through a lot of your educational experiences with the same people. All the way from my first day at kindergarten to my last day of high school was spent with many of the same peers - a situation a lot of people don't get to (or don't ever want to) go through. With a limited amount of schools in the area, we all got to know each other very well and spent a lot of time learning the same things as we got older. Moving off to college was really weird and somewhat frightening at first, but after the first few weeks of adjustment, it's turned into one of the most eye opening and enjoyable experiences I've ever had.</p>
