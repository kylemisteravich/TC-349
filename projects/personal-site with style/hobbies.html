    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>In my free time, you will usually find me obsessively listening or trying to make music. Ever since I was a little kid and first heard the Beatles, I've been totally absorbed by the feelings that a good song can bring. It's a form of entertainment that can compliment any feeling, mood, or occasion when you really need it to - as well as having the ability to add an entirely new perspective to any moment you apply it to. At the end of the day, I always look forward to sitting down, turning on an album or playlist, and letting my mind float away. A <b>few</b> of my favorite musical artists include (in no particular order):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The White Stripes</li>
        <li>Red Hot Chili Peppers</li>
        <li>The Beatles</li>
        <li>Radiohead</li>
        <li>The Beach Boys</li>
        <li>Funkadelic</li>
        <li>... and many others that would make this list much too long.</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>Like many other people, I also really enjoy watching films, playing video games, and spending time with my family and friends. More recently, I've been getting really into Quentin Tarantino's filmography (<i>Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Bastards,</i> etc.) as well as rockumentaries like <i>Under Great White Northern Lights, Don't Look Back,</i> and <i>I am Trying to Break Your Heart</i>.</p>
