I never even knew that there was a mobile MSU website and I've been going here for almost two years. I don't know if it's because I haven't paid attention whenever I saw advertisements for it around or campus or if the university in general thinks the website is underwhelming. Either way, I'm going to side with the latter of the two.

MSU's mobile website (although fairly impressive for a universities mobile presence) is a boring website. There is no excitement to the layout, the buttons aren't engaging (or visually appealing), and the overall interface feels outdated. This is the first time that I've ever even visited the site and I don't feel compelled to ever visit it again. Not because I had a horrible experience or anything, but I just feel like the site doesn't get any love and that whoever has to manage it doesn't care much to keep everything updated. 

To be fair, though, the mobile site is straight to the point and appears to do exactly what it is supposed to - deliver you whatever information that it can efficiently and easily. There isn't much depth to the thing, but it does a good job of avoiding confusion for a newcomer. I like the search and map functionalities that it has (which could be very helpful when trying to find something on campus), but other than that, I see myself fusing this page very rarely, if ever.

Overall, it's an easy site, but it lacks any kind of excitement or appeal.
