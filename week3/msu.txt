    The official Michigan State University webpage overall is nice. Having had the experience of being regularly forced to navigate through the official webpage at Western Michigan University in order to find information, schedule classes, and browse through university activities, the MSU site has a better overall experience and feels as if more effort has been put into it. The layout is straight forward and has very clear labels that take you to exactly where you assume it will take you. There is a minimal amount of clutter and just enough information on many of the pages to provide a satisfactory experience and deliver exactly what it is you are looking for.
    From an overall design standpoint, the website is OK. Being as it is a university website, they are limited in the amount of flashiness and navigation sophistication they are able to implement in order to prevent people from being confused - which is very understandable. It wouldn't make much sense to have cutting edge web design and avant-garde layout setups on a website used mainly for educational purposes. Some people visiting the site might get confused, frustrated, or overwhelmed when visiting the site and carry those feeling over to their perception of the university - causing problems for the visitors as well as the university.
    To make the site better, I think implementing more subtle hints of green in the layout, maybe displaying a picture and paragraph of a "student/professor of the week," and possibly incorporating a flowing twitter feed throughout the site could make it a little bit more relatable to visitors. Some of the suggestions may seem obvious (and might have even been tried on msu.edu before and failed), but I think in the technologically advanced information age that we live in, it would only be in the best effort of the university to constantly strive to better their site.
